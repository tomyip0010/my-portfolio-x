## Data privacy

During my software developer placement at Westpac Group, one of my responsibilities was to prepare materials for my placement plans and portfolio. However, being in the banking industry, data privacy is of utmost importance. As a developer, it was my duty to protect the digital properties of the company as well as the private data of clients.

To ensure that I was handling the situation responsibly and ethically, I took the necessary steps to investigate what kind of data was valid for sharing from the placement context. I consulted my manager for the sharing requirement and was advised that all data copy should be done through the official company email account with the proper statement about the necessity of sending the data to my private account. This way, it was trackable for the company to audit.

Reflecting on this experience, I believe that I handled the situation appropriately and responsibly. By seeking the advice of my manager and following proper procedures, I was able to ensure that I was not mishandling any private data or breaching ethical conduct standards.

In the future, I believe that I could improve my approach to handling such situations by proactively seeking out guidance on ethical and professional conduct in the ICT industry. This way, I can stay up-to-date on emerging ethical dilemmas in science and technology, piracy, and cybersecurity, among other key areas of consideration.

Overall, my experience at Westpac Group taught me the importance of maintaining professionalism and ethical conduct as an ICT professional, particularly in the banking industry. By being responsible and accountable for my actions, I can ensure that I am contributing to a culture of responsibility and ethical behaviour in the workplace.
