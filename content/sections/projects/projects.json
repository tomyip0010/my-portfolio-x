      "description": "Through these various work experiences, I have developed a strong sense of being a challenge taker. Each industry has its own unique set of challenges, and I have always been excited to take on these challenges head-on. For example, in my first job as a developer, my team was tasked with building a talent recruitment platform from scratch. This required me to not only learn the latest React JS programming but also to work collaboratively with my team to develop a cutting-edge platform that could compete with existing ones. Similarly, at the multimedia creative agency, I was tasked with developing commerce and gaming websites using ThreeJS and JS canvas. This was a completely new skillset for me, and I had to quickly learn how to utilize these technologies to develop visually appealing and interactive websites. In my most recent role, as a developer for a Singapore-based start-up, I was challenged with delivering multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for cryptocurrency exchange. This involved working with the latest web3 technologies, such as blockchain and NFT. Through all of these experiences, I have developed a valuable skillset that includes problem-solving, adaptability, and a willingness to take on new challenges. These attributes are critical for success in the rapidly-evolving tech industry, and I look forward to bringing them to my next role as a software developer.",
