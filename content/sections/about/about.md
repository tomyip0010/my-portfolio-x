As an aspiring full stack web developer, I am deeply committed to delivering successful projects by fostering effective teamwork. My passion lies in providing comprehensive support across both frontend and backend development, ensuring prompt and efficient solutions. With a major in Software Development during my Master of Information Technology at Griffith University, I have gained a holistic understanding of web development.

Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in project management, database design, and web programming. This knowledge has equipped me with a solid foundation to tackle complex challenges in the field. In my recent Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) placement at Westpac, I had the opportunity to contribute as a software developer, actively collaborating with a diverse team to enhance various UI features and backend functionalities within the banking application.

My prior experience working with multiple startups has provided me with valuable insights into developing and maintaining applications at scale. The placement at Westpac expanded my understanding of contrasting approaches to architecture, reinforcing my commitment to becoming a well-rounded full stack developer.

With a strong focus on teamwork, a comprehensive skill set in web development, and hands-on experience in both startups and corporate settings, I am poised to contribute effectively to the success of future projects. My long-term goal is to leverage my expertise to create innovative and user-centric web applications that drive positive change in the industry.
