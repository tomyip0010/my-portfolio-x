## Complex problem solving / Communication skill / Decision making

Reflecting on my journey from being an undergraduate student to pursuing a Master's degree, I recognize a significant shift in my approach to learning. During my undergraduate studies, the project context was typically provided, and I was guided by set guidelines to develop solutions within the given domain. Communication was limited to a small team, and my learning was predominantly passive in nature.

However, my postgraduate studies presented a different landscape. The given context for projects or assignments was often insufficient, requiring me to take a proactive approach by conducting extensive research. I learned the importance of engaging with individuals from diverse expertise to achieve desired outcomes, necessitating a deep understanding of professional norms and terminologies. This shift marked a transition from passive learning to an active and proactive approach, driven by curiosity and a hunger for deeper understanding.

In addition to changes in learning approach, my postgraduate studies exposed me to a broader range of stakeholders and communication channels. While undergraduate projects involved communication within a limited team, postgraduate studies required me to interact with various stakeholders, including business analysts, technical officers, and testers. This expanded communication scope allowed me to better comprehend project requirements and constraints, and it fostered collaboration across different disciplines.

Furthermore, the decision-making process evolved significantly during my postgraduate studies. Previously, decisions were often based on the context provided by the course, without the need for extensive data or analysis. However, in my postgraduate studies, I learned that decisions must be supported by empirical evidence, requiring me to reference third-party reports, theories, and conduct trial and performance testing. Thorough testing, reporting, and documentation became integral to substantiating decisions and ensuring their effectiveness.

Looking ahead, I firmly believe that my approach to continuous learning will be vital for my success in the workplace. As I embark on my professional career, I recognize that each project will present unique contexts and requirements, demanding the development of customized solutions. Continuous learning will empower me to acquire new skills and knowledge that are essential for crafting innovative and effective solutions that align with organizational goals.

Moreover, in an increasingly diverse and globally connected workplace, effective communication will be crucial. My experience in learning how to communicate and collaborate with diverse stakeholders during my postgraduate studies has equipped me with valuable skills that will enable me to work efficiently within diverse teams. By embracing ongoing learning, I will continually adapt and refine my communication abilities, ensuring effective collaboration and understanding across various contexts and cultures.

In conclusion, my experience of pursuing a Master's degree after completing my undergraduate studies has not only enhanced my skills and knowledge but also transformed my approach to learning. As I prepare to enter the workforce, I recognize that my commitment to continuous learning and my experiences in decision-making, communication, and collaboration will be instrumental in addressing the unique challenges that await me. I am confident that my proactive and adaptable approach to learning will position me for success as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of my future career.
